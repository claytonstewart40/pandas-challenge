Got help from a TA, location is in the jupyter file.  

Overview
As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, the primary goal is to analyze district-wide standardized test results. This analysis involves examining data from each student's math and reading scores, along with information on their schools, to identify trends in school performance that will inform future budgeting and strategic decisions for the district.

Repository Setup
Repository Name: pandas-challenge
Local Setup: Clone the repository and create a folder named PyCitySchools for the assignment.
Main Script: The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook added to the PyCitySchools folder.

Data Analysis Components

District Summary
Objective: Provide a snapshot of the district's key metrics.
Metrics Included:
Total number of schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students passing math
Percentage of students passing reading
Overall passing percentage

School Summary
Objective: Summarize key metrics for each school.
Metrics Included:
School name and type
Total students
Total school budget and budget per student
Average scores in math and reading
Passing percentages for math, reading, and overall performance analysis.

Highest-Performing Schools: Identify and display the top 5 schools by overall passing percentage.
Lowest-Performing Schools: Identify and display the bottom 5 schools by overall passing percentage.
Scores by Grade, School Spending, Size, and Type

Math and Reading Scores by Grade: Calculate and display average scores for each grade level at each school.
Scores by School Spending: Analyze school performance based on average spending per student, categorized into four bins.
Scores by School Size: Group schools based on their size (small, medium, large) and analyze performance.
Scores by School Type: Compare performance metrics across different types of schools (e.g., charter vs. district).

Insights and Observable Trends
The analysis aims to uncover patterns in school performance, focusing on factors such as budget allocations, school size, and type. Through careful examination of the data, the report will highlight at least two observable trends that could guide the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future investments and strategic priorities in the education sector.

Conclusion
This summary encapsulates the scope and objectives of the PyCity Schools analysis assignment. By employing pandas for data manipulation and analysis within a Jupyter Notebook environment, this comprehensive examination of school performance data serves as a foundation for data-driven decision-making in the city's school district.
